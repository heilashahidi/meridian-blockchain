//! Meridian on-chain CLOB — program error codes.
//!
//! Variants are introduced as the corresponding instruction lands; the
//! current set was bootstrapped by U3 (`initialize_config`,
//! `create_strike_market`) and the predeclared errors the planning doc
//! lists for U4-U7 (`mint_pair`, order ops, settlement, redeem).
//!
//! Mapping back to the plan:
//!   * `Unauthorized` — signer-vs-state mismatch (e.g. non-admin calling
//!     admin-only instructions, cancel by non-owner).
//!   * `AlreadyInitialized` — `initialize_config` called twice.
//!   * `ProgramPaused` — `config.paused` set; any user-facing instruction
//!     refuses.
//!   * `InvalidAmount` — zero or out-of-range amount/qty/price.
//!   * `MarketSettled` / `MarketNotSettled` — settle gate flipping order
//!     entry and redeem off respectively.
//!   * `MarketNotExpired` — settle called before `clock.unix_timestamp` >=
//!     `market.expiry_unix`.
//!   * `OracleStale` / `OracleConfidenceTooWide` — Pyth feed checks at
//!     `settle_market` (U7).
//!   * `BookFull` / `OrderNotFound` — surface the matching engine's
//!     intrinsic errors at the Anchor boundary.
